#  Release notes

***3 Oct 2017*** - v2.1 released

- Updates to `/api/v1` and `/api/v2` to remove JSON responses from the `/bankaccount` service. See [v2.1 release notes](/docs/releasenotes/v2.1)
  - `/api/v1/bankaccount/200415.json` removed. Future access will result in `404 Not Found` responses.
  - `/api/v1/bankaccount/200415/38290008.json` removed. Future access will result in `404 Not Found` responses.
  - `/api/v2/bankaccount/200415.json` removed. Future access will result in `404 Not Found` responses.
  - `/api/v2/bankaccount/200415/38290008.json` removed. Future access will result in `404 Not Found` responses.
- Update to `/api/v2` of `/bankaccount` to return a of `content-type text/xml` to better replicate an internal live legacy system's behaviour 

**The API endpoints have not been changed.  No other changes have been made to the other API's**

> The `/bankaccount` API was intended to replicate legacy API's that are used within the British Library, and to simulate the similar functional requirements and behaviours. In order to ensure that the vendor submissions can support this style of interface, the JSON endpoint has been withdrawn.
> The `.json` feature was included to `/api/v2` in error and apologies for any confusion this incurred.

### Detailed change log
- `/bankaccount` ONLY supports XML responses
  - Removed `.json` to the URI on both v1 and v2 API's
- `/catalogue` - no changes
- `/identity` - no changes
