#  Release notes

***29 Sept 2017*** - v2.1 released

### Description of change

The `/bankaccount` API, as a part of the product demonstration evaluation criteria, was intended to replicate legacy API's that are used within the British Library, and to simulate similar functional requirements and behaviours. In order to ensure that the vendor submissions can support this style of interface the `/bankaccount` API for v1 and v2 have been changed to and the JSON endpoints have been withdrawn.
